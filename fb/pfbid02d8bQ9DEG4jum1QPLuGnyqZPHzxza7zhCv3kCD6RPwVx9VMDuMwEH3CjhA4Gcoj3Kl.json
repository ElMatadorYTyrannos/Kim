I\u2019m never on Facebook anymore.\n\nBut I wanted to investigate so I opened Facebook to do what I needed to do and since I was still in bed, when I shifted around, my thumb scrolled the page and landed on a post that made my heart sink so deep.\n\nIt was this post.\n\nShe was JUST on my mind the other day. I was thinking about how she\u2019s an engineer and how great that is and about some of the stories she\u2019s posted\u2014like the one where she wanted to learn French, but her mom wanted her to take Spanish classes and then she ended up marrying into a French family (such a cute story)\u2014and how she\u2019s one of the people I miss the most about not being active on Facebook anymore.\n\nWe used to send each other messages of comfort during Trump's presidency because everything felt so upside down to us, \u201cwe\u2019ll get through this\u201d and \u201cthere's hope because of XYZ\u201d and \"thank you for saying what you did\u2014I feel less alone\" She was one of the friends who would often say \u201cI wish we were neighbors!\u201d And I truly wish we were! It would have been so fun.\n\nI knew Kim from elementary school. Maybe since first grade? We never had any classes together\u2014she was always in the advanced classes, but maybe we had a few art and music classes together\u2014and we weren\u2019t super close, but we were friends enough to keep in touch as soon as the technology allowed us to be. Of all the faces of the kids we went to elementary school with, hers is always so clear to me, like if I was asked to think of all the kids that went to Mission Glen with me, hers would be among them\u2014Kim with the brown hair and the big smile and that dimple so deep.\n\nI just cannot believe she\u2019s gone. My heart goes out to her, her husband and two boys, and her family. I hope they find comfort in this great big loss.",
